They fought for 10 minutes and in that moment, both of them didn't paint the fence. After the fight, Bandi leaves and Bando finished painting the fence alone. If Bando finished painting the fence at 14:25, at what time did the fight occur? (State your answer in 24 hours time span. If the time is at o'clock state it as an integer, e.g.: 15:00 -> 15.
